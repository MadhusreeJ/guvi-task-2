        Document VS Window Objects:
        The window is a global object holding variables, functions, history and location. The document comes 
        under the window and is considered the property of the window. The Document and Window objects are 
        fundamental parts of the web browsing environment in JavaScript, 
        but they serve different purposes and contexts:

        Document Object:
             The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser window 
           or frame. It provides access to the content and structure of the web page, allowing JavaScript to
            manipulate and interact with the elements on the page.
            <h4>Key properties and methods of the document object include:</h4>
             - "document.getElementById(id)": Returns the element with the specified ID.
             - "document.getElementsByTagName(name)": Returns a collection of elements with the specified
              tag name.
             - "document.createElement(tagName)": Creates a new element node.
             - "document.body": Returns the `<body>` element of the document.
             - "document.title": Returns the title of the document.
           - Essentially, the document object is a representation of the entire HTML structure of the current
            web page, providing methods to interact with its elements and content.
        
        Window Object:
             The window object represents the browser window that contains the DOM document. It serves as the
            global object for JavaScript in the browser environment, and it can be used to control the browser
             itself rather than just the web page content.
             
           Key properties and methods of the window object include:
             - "window.alert(message)": Displays an alert dialog with the specified message.
             - "window.innerWidth" and "window.innerHeight": Returns the interior width and height of the 
             browser window.
             - "window.location": Provides information about the current URL and can be used to navigate to a 
             new page.
             - "window.localStorage" and "window.sessionStorage": Provide storage mechanisms for storing 
             key-value pairs locally.
           - The "window" object encapsulates not only the current browsing context but also methods and 
           properties for controlling the browser itself, managing navigation, handling dialogs, and managing
            browser history.
        
        Key Differences:
        Scope and Context: The document object deals specifically with the structure and content of the
         HTML document loaded in the browser window. It represents the DOM hierarchy of elements.
        Global Context: The window object is the global object in the browser environment, encompassing
         the entire browser window and providing access to methods and properties that control the browser 
         itself, as well as the environment in which the document is displayed.
        Hierarchy: The document object is a part of the window object. It can be accessed via 
        "window.document" or simply "document".
        
        In summary, while the document object represents the HTML structure and content of the current web
         page, allowing interaction with its elements, the window object serves as the global environment in
          which the document resides, providing control over the browser window and its behavior.
